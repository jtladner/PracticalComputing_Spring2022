# Class 4 - Feb. 4th 2022
- In this class we will learn:
    - about three different ways to run Python code
    - about six of the most common data types in Python
    - to use a Jupyter Notebook to write and execute Python code

### Required Reading (**Must be completed ahead of time**)
Practical Computing for Biologists, Chapters 7-8

[Jupyter Notebook Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook)

### Assignment

1. Use Jupyter Notebook to open "PythonPt1-Class4.ipynb". This notebook will introduce you to the Python syntax for serveral major variable types and some of their commonly used methods. Read through each cell of the notebook and execute the contained code using "control+enter", "shift+enter" or by pressing the play button at the top of the Notebook. Six of the cells are empty and there for you to complete the different parts of the assignment. Enter your code for each part of the assignment directly within the notebook cells. When you have finished all of the different parts of the assignment, **download your completed notebook as a .pdf and/or an .html file and upload to BbLearn.**

2. Open your terminal and enter the interactive Python shell. The command ```python``` should do the trick. If not, try  ```python3```.
This interface is really useful as a test bed, to make sure that commands work as you expect before adding them to your script. Test out a few of the commands you learned in Part 1 of the assignment and then **submit a screenshot of your interactive session via BbLearn.**
